Initialize pins, etc.

main loop:
  check sensor
    mode 4: wait 10 seconds, if the solenoid has not retracted indicate fault.
  check control pot (port A pin 0)
    convert from analog to digital
    if 0 return fault (except mode 1)
    convert from analog to digital: X = .25*(digital output value)...Store X in "Count" register...
    mode 3: if value> 112(decimal) solenoid engage , value<112(decimal solenoid disengage
    
  check green button
    if pressed: enter new mode (when restarting the microconroller must press this to enter mode 1)
    swicht LED indicator lights to indicate mode
  
  check red button (port C pin 1)
    mode 1:if pressed: toggle transistor gate (moving actuator) (with port D output pin) 
    mode 2:if pressed: Activate acuator for X seconds ("If the pushbutton is pressed and released in the middle of the timeout, the timer will be restarted
    from that point.")
        check control pot (Port A pin 0): (for mode 2: determines X seconds):
    mode 3:if pressed: toggle control on/off: Active- turn on LED, inactive - turn off LED
    mode 4: same as mode 2 except sensor overide after 10 seconds
