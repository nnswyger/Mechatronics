Initialize pins, etc.

main loop:
  check sensor
  check control pot (port A pin 0)
    convert from analog to digital
    
  check green button
    if pressed: enter new mode (when restarting the microconroller must press this to enter mode 1)
    swicht LED indicator lights to indicate mode
  
  check red button (port C pin 1)
    mode 1:if pressed: toggle transistor gate (moving actuator) (with port D output pin) 
    mode 2:if pressed: Activate acuator for X seconds (If the pushbutton is pressed and released in the middle of the timeout, the timer will be restarted
    from that point.)
        check control pot (Port A pin 0): (for mode 2: determines X seconds): convert from analog to digital: X = .25*(digital output value)...Store X as count...maximum = 64 seconds... min = 0 sec shoudl return fault light up LEDS. 
    mode 3:if pressed: toggle control on/off: Active- turn on LED, inactive - turn off LED
